# This is a configuration file for /etc/init.d/ebus; it allows you to
# perform common modifications to the behavior of the dbus daemon
# startup without editing the init script (and thus getting prompted
# by dpkg on upgrades).  We all love dpkg prompts.

# Default settings for ebusd. This file is sourced by /bin/sh from
# /etc/init.d/ebusd.
